How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We just saw our diff. So it helped. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could track my thought process as changes happened over the course and I found I was learning more about the requirements. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
git
pros - I don't have to go through unnecessary versions. 
cons - If I accidentally lost my changes without commiting, I cannot retrieve them. 

google docs
pros - I can always go back to any version I stored. 
cons - too many revision. 
 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git
Generally useful for code. 
related changes in many files. 

goog docs - useful for authors, etc. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log will have my thoughts as i was checking in changes. 
diff will have my changes. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

i can always go back to a previously working version and restart my changes. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
project.
